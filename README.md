Task 4 â€” RAG-Powered Conversational AI (Gemini API)
Overview

This web application is a RAG-powered chatbot that retrieves relevant facts from your uploaded documents and generates human-like answers using the Google Gemini API.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation:

First, the app retrieves context from your uploaded documents.

Then, the LLM (Gemini API) uses this context to generate polished, context-aware responses.

This approach ensures more accurate and informative answers compared to standard chatbots that rely solely on the model.

Features

âœ… Keyword-based semantic search for retrieving relevant context.

âœ… Integration with Google Gemini API for natural language generation.
